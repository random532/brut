This is a GUI for editing hard drives on FreeBSD (partition editor, disk editor). 
It uses gtk3. Screenshots below.

Install as a port:
1. Download ports/Makefile and ports/pkg-descr
2. Run "make makesum" and "make install clean"
3. (recommended: Run "dbus-uuigen --ensure")
4. Start it with xdisk :)
