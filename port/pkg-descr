xdisk is a multitool. Among its features are... 
- partition editor, disk editor
- group/user management
- date, time, timezone

It uses gtk3 for the GUI elements.
It uses sudo as backend. ${LOCALBASE}/etc/sudoers file handles the permissions.

Start it with xdisk.
If it complains about missing machine-id, run "dbus-uuidgen --ensure".
