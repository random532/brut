Graphical user interface (GUI) for various administrative tasks.

Features:
- partition editor, disk editor
- group/user management
- date, time, timezone

Some hints:
It uses gtk3 for the GUI elements.
It uses sudo as backend. /usr/local/etc/sudoers file handles the permissions.

If dbus complains about a missing machine-id, run "dbus-uuidgen --ensure".

The start command is: brut
