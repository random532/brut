# partition editor

This is a GUI partition editor for FreeBSD.
It uses X11, gtk.

- view disks, partitions, slices, labels, ...
- create, destroy, add, remove, modify, resize partitions/disks/slices
- set labels or attributes
- create file systems (ufs, fat32, ntfs)
- write .img files to disk (with optional sha checksum checking)

I have low self confidence, so please bear that in mind.
