xdisk is a partition editor with a graphical user interface.
It uses gtk3 for the GUI elements.
It uses sudo as backend.

Start it with xdisk.

If it complains about missing machine-id, run "dbus-uuidgen --ensure".
Command line options are -l (language, de, en), -c (ask for confirmation) and -f (fontsize).
